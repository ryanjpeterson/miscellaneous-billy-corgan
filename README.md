A work in progress to take a step back from javascript and learn some python for a change...

*img folder*
Image folder sits in the main directory with three subfolders, db, queue and posted. This folder structure must be created in order for this program to work at all.
  db is the repository of all random photos
  queue is the folder from which the post_a_corgan function grabs a random image to post
  posted is the repository of photos posted by the bot which are then moved from the queue folder to posted
